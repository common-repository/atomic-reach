== Description ==

This plugin displays the content of any Atomic Reach Tribe on your Website or blog, letting you offer more content and attract more readers. Even people who aren't members of Atomic Reach can download the plugin (although membership does have its privileges!).

There are two ways to display the Tribe's content: as a micro-site or within a widget on the sidebar. Both can be created quickly and leverage the design of your Website or blog.

To publish a new page featuring content from a Tribe, here are the steps:

1. Login into your WordPress dashboard, and click on "Pages" and then "Add New"

2. Create a title for the new page

3. Copy and paste the code below into the body of the page. Change the name of the uri from "contentcuration" to match your Tribe's name. You can decide on the number of posts to be displayed by changing the limit field, which is currently "3".

4. The content can be displayed in two ways - horizontal or vertical. To select the option you want, simply type in "horizontal" or "vertical" to the right of "horizontal" in the code. 

[arPosts limit="3" uri="contentcuration" layout="horizontal"]
